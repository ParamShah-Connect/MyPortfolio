        <h2>MERN Stack Developer | Intern at Gravitas Technosoft</h2>
        <p>Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap <br></br>

        I am a passionate MERN stack developer with hands-on experience in building full-stack web applications. Currently, I am honing my skills as an intern at Gravitas Technosoft, Ahmedabad, where I’ve worked on several projects using Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, MySQL, and Bootstrap to develop dynamic, responsive, and scalable applications.

        With a background in Information Technology from New LJ, I enjoy taking on challenges that push the boundaries of my expertise. I’m also driven by a desire to improve user experiences through efficient code and creative problem-solving.<br></br>

        Outside of coding, I’m an active public speaker, swimmer, and gym enthusiast, always striving to improve both professionally and personally. In the near future, I aim to leverage my technical expertise and soft skills to join an MNC or a reputable company where I can contribute to impactful projects and grow in a challenging environment.

        Feel free to connect if you want to discuss technology, career opportunities, or collaborate on exciting projects!
